# ViaEstimation

Documentation will be added as soon as we can get to it. We're focusing on getting [Via](https://github.com/copperpunk-elixir/via) up and running right now (which uses this package as a dependency). If you're trying to add an intertial reference system (INS) to your Elixir project and need a basic algorithm like this, visit www.copperpunk.com to drop us a line. We can surely get you on your way.

## Installation

This package can be installed by adding `via_estimation` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:via_estimation, "~> 0.1.1"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation (when it is written) can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/via_estimation](https://hexdocs.pm/via_estimation).
